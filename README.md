This project was inspired by my concern for the opioid crisis in America. According to the WHO, 
"Worldwide, in 2019 about 600 000 deaths were attributable to drug use. Close to 80% of these 
deaths are related to opioids, with about 25% of those deaths caused by opioid overdose.
There are effective treatment interventions for opioid dependence that can decrease the risk
of overdose, yet less than 10% of people who need such treatment are receiving it."

I used Python and SQL for this project. I implemented a GUI using the Tkinter library and 
implemented buttons that allow for creation of new patient record, updating current records
and deleting records. SQL is used to house patient records. Painkiller thresholds were implemented
by doing some research for painkillers and their suggested doses. Doses vary for certain drugs, IE
fentanyl recommended dose is 2 micrograms vs 250 milligrams of acetaminophen. Date validation
was incorporated to ensure expired medication isn't given to patients. 

Overall the goal of the project was to provide a model that may be used in hospital worldwide
to help safely administer painkiller prescriptions and create a safer environment for patients. 
Doses would ideally be monitored by nurses and prescriptions administed and/or renewed by
doctors. 

Note: this project does not take into consideration advanced pharmacology and HIPPA compliance.
I am a CS student who has concern of the opioid crisis in America and wanted to create a project
that would be an approach to help mitigate the opioid crisis.
